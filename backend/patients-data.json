The pain is described as throbbing and severe, with intensity 9/10. Duration: 6-12 hours. The symptoms are constant.\n\nAggravating factors include: light, loud noises, neck movement.\nRelieving factors include: dark room, quiet environment.\n\nAssociated Symptoms: fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea/vomiting, confusion\n\nPast Medical History: Mild anemia, Seasonal allergies\nCurrent Medications: Multivitamin daily, Iron supplement 65mg daily\nAllergies: Penicillin\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVital Signs:\n- Blood Pressure: 138/86 mmHg\n- Heart Rate: 108 bpm\n- Temperature: 102.4F\n- SpO2: 97%\n- Respiratory Rate: 22/min\n\nGeneral: Toxic appearance, Photophobic, Altered mental status\nCardiovascular: Tachycardic, Regular rhythm, No murmurs\nRespiratory: Clear to auscultation, Tachypneic\n\nNeurological: Positive Kernig's sign, Positive Brudzinski's sign, Nuchal rigidity present, GCS 14 (confused)\n\nASSESSMENT:\nSevere headache with fever - HIGH suspicion for Bacterial Meningitis\n\nClinical Impression: Patient presents with classic meningitis triad: headache, fever, and nuchal rigidity. Altered mental status and positive meningeal signs. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.\n\nPLAN:\n1. IMMEDIATE empiric antibiotics - Ceftriaxone 2g IV + Vancomycin 1g IV (avoid Penicillin - ALLERGY)\n2. Dexamethasone 0.15mg/kg IV before or with first antibiotic dose\n3. CT head without contrast STAT to rule out mass/elevated ICP\n4. Lumbar puncture immediately after CT if no contraindications\n5. Blood cultures x 2 before antibiotics if possible (do not delay antibiotics)\n6. Droplet precautions until etiology determined\n7. ICU admission\n8. Neurology and Infectious Disease consults",
